	abstract = {The Orienteering Problem (OP) seeks a path on a graph to maximize total rewards collected subject to a path length budget. Typically, a reward is achieved by visiting a vertex in the graph, and such a reward is constant for all time. This paper considers a variant of OP where the reward of each vertex is an arbitrary time-dependent function, and hence the name time-varying reward OP (TR-OP). To solve this problem, we develop a novel heuristic search algorithm called Reward Maximization A* (RMA*), which is guaranteed to find an optimal solution to TR-OP. We also develop a fast method to compute an admissible heuristic for RMA* that can effectively direct the search to save computational effort. Furthermore, we introduce a hyper-parameter in RMA* that trades off between solution quality and runtime efficiency for RMA*. We benchmark RMA* against a recent dynamic programming (DP) approach, which runs fast in practice, but has no guarantee of the solution optimality. In our tests, RMA* reduces the runtime by up to 70\% compared to DP. By adjusting the hyper-parameter, RMA* is able to find solutions with up to 30\% more rewards than those found by DP.},

	abstract = {We consider an orienteering problem (OP) where an agent needs to visit a series (possibly a subset) of depots, from which the maximal accumulated profits are desired within given limited time budget. Different from most existing works where the profits are assumed to be static, in this work we investigate a variant that has arbitrary time-dependent profits. Specifically, the profits to be collected change over time and they follow different (e.g., independent) time-varying functions. The problem is of inherent nonlinearity and difficult to solve by existing methods. To tackle the challenge, we present a simple and effective framework that incorporates time-variations into the fundamental planning process. Specifically, we propose a deterministic spatio-temporal representation where both spatial description and temporal logic are unified into one routing topology. By employing existing basic sorting and searching algorithms, the routing solutions can be computed in an extremely efficient way. The proposed method is easy to implement and extensive numerical results show that our approach is time efficient and generates near-optimal solutions.},

	abstract = {The NP-hard Traveling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows (TSPTW) is concerned with visiting a given set of customers within their assigned time windows such that a given objective function is minimized. In contrast to traditional problems, where each customer gets assigned its own time window, in modern web-based systems the supplying company defines a set of time windows, from which the customer can then choose one of them. Therefore, by design, typically several customers are assigned to the same time window. Motivated by this development and the fact that practitioners seek for formulations that can easily and quickly be implemented, we introduce two mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) for the asymmetric TSPTW that allow to computationally exploit the structure of the time windows and are also applicable for asymmetric travel times, for which the triangle inequalities do not hold. In particular we analyze and exploit the relations between time windows in order to reduce the number of binary variables in our MILPs. For the special case of non-overlapping time windows we can further simplify the constraint set and also reduce the number of continuous variables needed. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our MILPs on benchmark instances related to an online shopping application.},

	abstract = {Congestion in large cities and populated areas is one of the major challenges in urban logistics, and should be addressed at different planning and operational levels. The Time Dependent Travelling Salesman Problem (TDTSP) is a generalization of the well known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where the travel times are not assumed to be constant along the day. The motivation to consider the time dependency factor is that it enables to have better approximations to many problems arising from practice. In this paper, we consider the Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TDTSP-TW), where the time dependence is captured by considering variable average travel speeds. We propose an Integer Linear Programming model for the problem and develop an exact algorithm, which is compared on benchmark instances with another approach from the related literature. The results show that the approach is able to solve instances with up to 40 customers.},

In this paper, we present a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based approach for such a task and use the Gaussian Processes (GPs) as the underlying surrogate model. A spatial-temporal covariance is designed for the GPs to capture the time varying environment which is modeled using a Gaussian puff dynamic model. The performance achieved by using a fixed senor network and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is compared and analyzed. We construct a continuous path-based reward function, based on which BO will design an optimal, three-dimensional path for the UAV. A more challenging situation that involves multiple puff emissions is also considered. The UAV is shown to be able to monitor the periodic environment and track the highest concentration which is time-varying.},

Additionally, instances for The Road Transport (Working Time) Regulation 2005 that applies to drivers in the United Kingdom are introduced.

More precisely, the horizon is divided into time windows and with each one a coefficient is associated that is used to determine the actual processing time of a job starting in it. Two models are introduced, and one of them has direct connections with models considered in previous papers on scheduling problems with time-dependent processing times. Various computational complexity results are presented for the makespan criterion, which show that the problem is NP-hard, even with two time windows. Solving procedures are also proposed for some special cases.},
