	abstract = {In this paper, we study scheduling with step-learning, i.e., a setting where the processing times of the jobs started after their job-dependent learning-dates are reduced. The goal is to minimize makespan on a single machine. We focus first on the case that idle times between consecutive jobs are not allowed. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, implying that no polynomial-time solution exists and, consequently, propose a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm. An extensive numerical study is provided to examine the running time of the algorithm with different learning-dates and job processing time ranges. The special case of a common learning-date for all the jobs is also studied, and a (more efficient) pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming is introduced and tested numerically. In the last part of the paper, the more complicated setting in which idle times are allowed is studied. An appropriate dynamic programming is introduced and tested as well.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the processing times of jobs are assumed to be fixed and known throughout the entire process. However, recent empirical research in several industries has demonstrated that processing times decline as workers improve their skills and gain experience after doing the same task for a long time. This phenomenon is known as learning effects. Recently, several researchers have devoted a lot of effort on scheduling problems under learning effects. Although there is increase in the number of research in this topic, there are few review papers. The most recent one considers solely studies on scheduling problems with learning effects models prior to early 2007. For that, this paper focuses on reviewing the most recent advances in this field. First, we attempt to present a concise overview of some important learning models. Second, a new classification scheme for the different model of scheduling under learning effects is proposed and discussed. Next, a cartography showing the relation between some well-known models is proposed. Finally, our viewpoints and several areas for future research are provided.},

This problem consists of simultaneously selecting a subset of orders to be processed as well as determining the associated schedule. A common generalization includes sequence-dependent setup times and time windows. We propose a novel memetic algorithm for this problem, called Sparrow. It comprises a hybridization of biased random key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) and adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS). Sparrow integrates the exploration ability of BRKGA and the exploitation ability of ALNS. On a set of standard benchmark instances, this algorithm obtains better-quality solutions with runtimes comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms. To further understand the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms, their performance is also compared on a set of new benchmark instances with more realistic properties. We conclude that Sparrow is distinguished by its ability to solve difficult instances from the OAS literature, and that the hybrid steady-state genetic algorithm (HSSGA) performs well on large instances in terms of optimality gap, although taking more time than Sparrow.},

This paper investigates an alternative strategy for wind farm layout optimization by trading off the mean wind power output and power variance. Two optimization schemes, the weighted optimization and conﬁdence interval optimization are compared in term of their performances on trading off energy-variance. For the weighted optimization, the objective function weight value a varies from 0 to 1 (implying the optimization objective shifts its weight from the power variance to the power output), while for the conﬁdence interval (CI) optimization, either the lower or the upper limit of power output CI is maximized/minimized. It is found that the CI maximization achieves a trade-off of mean power output and power variance similar to the weighted optimization with a   0:6, and the same individual power output range (192 kWe207 kW) is obtained with staggered placements of wind turbines. The CI minimization obtains a trade-off of average power output and power variance close to the weighted optimization with a   0:4, and the optimal wind turbine locations are aligned. The advantage of CI optimization lies on its capability of predicting the power output uncertainty.},

We propose an efficient method for computing the optimal switching times for switched linear and nonlinear systems. A novel second-order optimization algorithm is introduced where, at each iteration, the dynamics are linearized over an underlying time grid to compute the cost function, the gradient, and the Hessian efficiently. With the proposed method, the most expensive operations at each iteration are shared between the cost function and its derivatives, thereby greatly reducing the computational burden. We have implemented the algorithm in the Julia package SwitchTimeOpt, allowing users to easily solve switching time optimization problems. In the case of linear dynamics, many operations can be further simplified and benchmarks show that our approach is able to provide optimal solutions in just a few millisecond. In the case of nonlinear dynamics, our method provides optimal solutions with up to two orders of magnitude time reductions over state-of-the-art approaches.},

An increasing number of users has led to the requirement of a job scheduling process, which can benefit them through optimizing their utility functions. On the other hand, resource providers are exploring strategies suitable for economically efficient resource allocation so that they can maximize their profit through satisfying more users. In such a scenario, economic-based resource management strategies (economic models) have been found to be compelling to satisfy both communities. However, existing research has identified that different economic models are suitable for different scenarios in Grid computing. The Grid application and resource models are typically very dynamic, making it challenging for a particular model for delivering stable performance all the time. In this work, our focus is to develop an adaptive resource management architecture capable of dealing with multiple models based on the models’ domains of strengths (DOS). Our preliminary results show promising outcomes if we consider multiple models rather than relying on a single model throughout the life cycle of a Grid.},

Our three-dimensional state–space–time network construct is able to comprehensively enumerate possible transportation states at any given time along vehicle space–time paths, and further allows a forward dynamic programming solution algorithm to solve the single vehicle VRPPDTW problem. By utilizing a Lagrangian relaxation approach, the primal multi-vehicle routing problem is decomposed to a sequence of single vehicle routing sub-problems, with Lagrangian multipliers for individual passengers’ requests being updated by sub-gradient-based algorithms. We further discuss a number of search space reduction strategies and test our algorithms, implemented through a specialized program in C++, on medium-scale and large-scale transportation networks, namely the Chicago sketch and Phoenix regional networks.},

We optimize cable layouts for real-world OWFs by a hop-indexed integer programming formulation, and develop a heuristic for computing layouts based on the Clarke and Wright savings heuristic for vehicle routing. Our heuristic computes layouts on average only 2\% more expensive than the optimal layout. Finally, we present two problem extensions arising from real-world OWF cable layouts, and adapt the integer programming formulation to one of them. The thus obtained optimal layouts are up to 13\% cheaper than the actually installed layouts.},

Most variants of the TSP consider total distance travelled. This paper presents a new generalised formulation of the TSP that aims to minimise the sum of functions of latencies to cities, rather than total distance travelled. Then, a new problem that uses a special function using the latency as input is presented, called the Travelling Maintainer Problem (TMP). The TMP integrates the output of prognostics in Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) with the TSP. CBM aims to minimise the failure and maintenance cost by identifying and predicting upcoming failures through the analysis of sensory information collected in real-time. Maintenance scheduling is performed using the predicted failure information obtained from the CBM. When the systems to be maintained are geographically distributed, maintenance scheduling requires integrated analysis of travel times and their effects on the failure progression in systems. This paper also presents Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation-based solutions and their comparisons for the TMP on a case study.},

The reduction in carbon dioxide levels by using hybrid electric vehicles is a currently ongoing endeavor. Although this development is quite advanced for hybrid electric passenger cars, small transporters and trucks are far behind. We try to address this challenge by introducing a new optimization problem that describes the delivery of goods with a hybrid electric vehicle to a set of customer locations. The Hybrid Electric Vehicle – Traveling Salesman Problem extends the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem by adding different modes of operation for the vehicle, causing different costs and driving times for each arc within a delivery network.
As the use of different modes of operation immensely increases the complexity of the problem, we present a heuristic solution approach, based mainly on a Tabu Search, to solve this optimization problem. Additionally, we provide a set of realistic benchmark instances based on real-world delivery tours to test and evaluate our solution approach. We also implemented a mathematical problem formulation and are able to solve small instances with the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio, which allows us to prove the quality of the solutions, provided by our heuristic.},

	abstract = {We present a multi-ob’jective two-echelon vehicle routing problem with vehicle synchronization and ‘grey zone’ customers arising in the context of urban freight deliveries. Inner-city center deliveries are performed by small vehicles due to access restrictions, while deliveries outside this area are carried out by conventional vehicles for economic reasons. Goods are transferred from the first to the second echelon by synchronized meetings between vehicles of the respective echelons. We investigate the assignment of customers to vehicles, i.e., to the first or second echelon, within a so-called ‘grey zone’ on the border of the inner city and the area around it. While doing this, the economic objective as well as negative external effects of transport, such as emissions and disturbance (negative impact on citizens due to noise and congestion), are taken into account to include objectives of companies as well as of citizens and municipal authorities. Our metaheuristic – a large neighborhood search embedded in a heuristic rectangle/cuboid splitting – addresses this problem efficiently. We investigate the impact of the free assignment of part of the customers (‘grey zone’) to echelons and of three different city layouts on the solution. Computational results show that the impact of a ‘grey zone’ and thus the assignment of these customers to echelons depend significantly on the layout of a city. Potentially pareto-optimal solutions for two and three objectives are illustrated to efficiently support decision makers in sustainable city logistics planning processes.},

	abstract = {Recently, the multimodal last-mile e-mobility concept has been at the center of attention for cleaner, greener, and more accessible urban deliveries. As part of sustainable transportation systems, multimodal e-mobility is proper for a variety of logistics operations as well as medical applications. This work tries to address a novel application of multimodal e-mobility through introducing and modeling the traveling salesman problem with drone and bicycle (TSP-D-B). Therefore, a novel mixed integer linear programming model is developed to formulate the problem wherein the total traveling time is minimized. As part of the last-mile delivery, a fleet of three vehicles including a truck, a drone, and a bicycle is taken into account to serve the customers in a single visit. The truck is considered as the main vehicle, while the drone and bicycle can be preferred in case of emergencies such as traffic or route failures. In order to assess the complexity, validity and applicability of the offered model, a dataset including 64 different benchmarks is generated, and according to the findings, the model is able to efficiently solve the benchmarks for up to 50 customers in 685 s maximum. A comparison is also made between TSP-D-B, the classic version of the TSP and the TSP-D, which reveals that TSP-D-B provides appropriate service time savings in all benchmarks. Finally, another comparative analysis is made using several instances adapted from the literature. It is revealed that TSP-D-B leads to significant time savings in most instances.},

	abstract = {The spread of COVID-19 outbreak has promoted truck-drone delivery from trials to commercial applications in end-to-end contactless solutions. To fully integrate truck-drone delivery in contactless solutions, we introduce the robust traveling salesman problem with a drone, in which a drone makes deliveries and returns to the truck that is moving on its route under uncertainty. The challenge is to ﬁnd, for each customer location in truck-drone routing, an assignment to minimize the expected makespan. Apart from the complexity of this problem, the risk of synchronization failure associated with uncertain travel time should be also considered. The problem is ﬁrst formulated as a robust model, and a novel eﬃcient frontier heuristic is proposed to solve this model. By coupling the implicit adaptive weighting with epsilon-constraint methods, the heuristic generates a series of scalarized single-objective problems, where the goal is to minimize expected makespan under the constraint of synchronization risk. The experiment results show that the robust (near-)optimal solutions oﬀer a considerable reduction in risk, yet only hint at a small increase in makespan. The heuristic in the present study is eﬀective to construct approximations of Pareto frontier and allows for assignment decisions in a priori or a posteriori manner.},
