	abstract = {Traditionally, the processing times of jobs are assumed to be fixed and known throughout the entire process. However, recent empirical research in several industries has demonstrated that processing times decline as workers improve their skills and gain experience after doing the same task for a long time. This phenomenon is known as learning effects. Recently, several researchers have devoted a lot of effort on scheduling problems under learning effects. Although there is increase in the number of research in this topic, there are few review papers. The most recent one considers solely studies on scheduling problems with learning effects models prior to early 2007. For that, this paper focuses on reviewing the most recent advances in this field. First, we attempt to present a concise overview of some important learning models. Second, a new classification scheme for the different model of scheduling under learning effects is proposed and discussed. Next, a cartography showing the relation between some well-known models is proposed. Finally, our viewpoints and several areas for future research are provided.},

	abstract = {This letter explores a variation of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, where the agent places a circular obstacle next to each node once it visits it. Referred to as the Traveling Salesperson Problem with Circle Placement (TSP-CP), the aim is to maximize the obstacle radius for which a valid closed tour exists and then minimize the tour cost. The TSP-CP finds relevance in various real-world applications, such as harvesting, quarrying, and open-pit mining. We propose several novel solvers to address the TSP-CP, its variant tailored for Dubins vehicles, and a crucial subproblem known as the Traveling Salesperson Problem on self-deleting graphs (TSP-SD). Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed solvers outperform the current state-of-the-art on related problems in solution quality.},

	abstract = {When planning missions for autonomous machines in real-world scenarios, such as open-pit mining, painting, or harvesting, it is important to consider how the machines will alter the working environment during their operations. Traditional planning methods treat such changes, like piles built during drilling, as constraints given to the planner that depend on the machine's trajectory. The goal is to find a trajectory that satisfies these constraints. However, our approach formulates the planning problem as finding optimal positions for changes, such as piles, along the machine's trajectory. We propose a heuristic solver and provide extensive experimental evaluations.},

	abstract = {The Order Acceptance and Scheduling (OAS) problem describes a class of real-world problems such as in smart manufacturing and satellite scheduling. This problem consists of simultaneously selecting a subset of orders to be processed as well as determining the associated schedule. A common generalization includes sequence-dependent setup times and time windows. We propose a novel memetic algorithm for this problem, called Sparrow. It comprises a hybridization of biased random key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) and adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS). Sparrow integrates the exploration ability of BRKGA and the exploitation ability of ALNS. On a set of standard benchmark instances, this algorithm obtains better-quality solutions with runtimes comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms. To further understand the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms, their performance is also compared on a set of new benchmark instances with more realistic properties. We conclude that Sparrow is distinguished by its ability to solve difficult instances from the OAS literature, and that the hybrid steady-state genetic algorithm (HSSGA) performs well on large instances in terms of optimality gap, although taking more time than Sparrow.},
